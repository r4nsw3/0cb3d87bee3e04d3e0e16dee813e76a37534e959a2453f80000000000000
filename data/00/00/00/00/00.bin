  |   You play as Sydney Hunter, an explorer who gets trapped inside a      |
  |   Maya pyramid while he is out exploring the region.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Sydney soon discovers that Kinich Ahau (the Maya sun god) and         |
  |   Kukulkan (the feathered serpent god) have broken up the sacred Maya   |
  |   Haab calendar into seven separate pieces, has taken four precious     |
  |   idols, and are hiding them throughout the pyramid.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This all comes during the time of Wayab; the five unlucky days of     |
  |   the year. This has caused great chaos, and time to freeze if the      |
  |   Haab calendar isn't found and put back together in time.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The local Maya now ask Sydney to go out and find all seven pieces     |
  |   of the Haab calendar, reclaim the important idols, defeat the Maya    |
  |   gods, and bring peace and balance back to the Maya civilization.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In doing so restoring time to continue...                             |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Update Notes: v1.1.05 (v65536). Firmware 9.0.1 and master key 9.0     |
  |   are required.                                                         |

  |   Updated Controls: Added a keyboard mapping option and changed         |
  |   controller default controls so both Y and A are now assigned to       |
  |   Attack. The "Up + Attack" feature - intended for those using the      |
  |   awesome NES-style Switch controller - is now disabled by default      |
  |   (preventing accidental use by those using the standard                |
  |   controllers).                                                         |

  |   Improved Difficulty Balance: The game is now more forgiving;          |
  |   players remain invincible a little longer after taking a hit - and    |
  |   a brand new save spot has been included at a convenient location      |
  |   early in the game.                                                    |
